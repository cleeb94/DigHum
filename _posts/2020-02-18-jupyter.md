The (in Jupyter) provided code for "Topic Modeling" had to be run for the full dispatch. In order to extract the full dispatch in the format necessary for using Jupyter, I wrote the following code: 

```
import re
import os

source_location = "./practice3/"   # the folder in which the "dispatch" is
target_location = "./TSV_files/" # the folder in which the new files will be saved 

lof=os.listdir(source_location) # getting all files from a folder
list_items= [] # to append list of items at the end, now out of loop 

up_header = "id\tdate\ttype\theader\ttext\n"


for f in lof: # looping through all the files

    new_file=f + "_modified.xml" # need to add the extension to work with it
    
    with open(source_location + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
        text0 = f1.read() # reads the file in
        
        ## Extracting the date of the Issue = date of the articles

        date_section = re.search(r"<titlePage>([\n-^\w—]*)</titlePage>", text0).group(1) #finds the section where the date is in
        issue_date=re.search(r"<date value=\"([\d-]*)\" authname",date_section).group(1) #extracts the date of the issue


        ## Getting the articles

        results = re.split(r"<div3 ", text0) # split the text into the div3 parts
        count= 0 # to be able to number the articles later

        for r in results[1:]: #first one is a "library"
            count = count +1
            r ="<div3 " + r # reattach so that it can be canceled out later on
    
            ## type
    
            try:
                item_type=re.search(r"type=\"(\w*)\" ",r).group(1) #check if it has a type, save it
            except:
                item_type="noItemType"
        
            ## header of article
    
            try: 
                header_section= re.search(r"<head>(.*)</head>",r).group(1) #check if it has a header, save it
            except: 
                header_section = "NoHeader"
        
            ## cleaning 
            
            if item_type == "article": 
                
                clean = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", r) #get rid of all < >
                clean = re.sub(" +\n|\n +","\n",clean) #get rid of all line breaks with spacing
                clean = clean.strip() #get rid of all spacing in beginning and end
                clean = re.sub("\n+","",clean) #get rid of all additional line breaks
                clean = re.sub("\t+","",clean) #get rid of all additional line breaks
                text = clean + "\n"
                header = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", header_section) #cleaning header of < > 
                ID = issue_date + "_" + item_type + "_" + str(count)
    
            ## collecting all information
    
                if len(re.sub("\W","", clean)) != 0: #noticed that some don't have text but still something -> this way don't include them
                    record= ID + "\t" + issue_date +"\t"+ item_type + "\t" + header + "\t" + text #create record information
                
                    list_items.append(record)    #append to list of all items in this issue

        ## saving files

new_issue ="".join(list_items) #combines the parts

new_file="dispatch_full.tsv" # need to add the extension to work with it
with open(target_location+new_file, "w", encoding ="utf8") as f2: #open in target folder
    f2.write(up_header + new_issue) #write in one file all the information
```


However, as my computer was unable to perform the analysis with the full dispatch on Jupyter without terminating the program due to too much memory demand - I split the data into separate files for each year, using the following python code: 

```
import re
import os

source_location = "./practice3/"   # the folder in which the "dispatch" is
target_location = "./TSV_files/" # the folder in which the new files will be saved 

lof=os.listdir(source_location) # getting all files from a folder

def tgn(year):
    list_items= []
    up_header = "id\tdate\ttype\theader\ttext\n"
    
    for f in lof: # looping through all the files

        new_file=f + "_modified.xml" # need to add the extension to work with it
    
        with open(source_location + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
            text0 = f1.read() # reads the file in
        
        ## Extracting the date of the Issue = date of the articles

            date_section = re.search(r"<titlePage>([\n-^\w—]*)</titlePage>", text0).group(1) #finds the section where the date is in
            issue_date=re.search(r"<date value=\"([\d-]*)\" authname",date_section).group(1) #extracts the date of the issue
            issue_year=re.search(r"(\d\d\d\d)",issue_date).group(1)

        ## Getting the articles
            
        results = re.split(r"<div3 ", text0) # split the text into the div3 parts
        count= 0 # to be able to number the articles later

        for r in results[1:]: #first one is a "library"
            count = count +1
            r ="<div3 " + r # reattach so that it can be canceled out later on
    
            ## type
    
            try:
                item_type=re.search(r"type=\"(\w*)\" ",r).group(1) #check if it has a type, save it
            except:
                item_type="noItemType"
        
            ## header of article
    
            try: 
                header_section= re.search(r"<head>(.*)</head>",r).group(1) #check if it has a header, save it
            except: 
                header_section = "NoHeader"
            
            if item_type == "article": 
                if int(issue_year) == int(year):
               
            ## cleaning 
    
                    clean = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", r) #get rid of all < >
                    clean = re.sub(" +\n|\n +","\n",clean) #get rid of all line breaks with spacing

                    header = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", header_section) #cleaning header of < > 
                    ID = issue_date + "_" + item_type + "_" + str(count)
    
            ## collecting all information
                    if len(re.sub("\W","", clean)) != 0: #noticed that some don't have text but still something -> this way don't include them

The observations for different years was compared using once 30 topics, and once 40 topics.

## The year 1861:

26082 articles

number of words (already "listed" ones): 69846

number of low frequency words (0  or 1): 30700

### 30 topics:

### 40 topics:

## The year 1862:

When comparing the results with the ones from "mining the dispatch" similarities can be seen. Topic "t11" seems to be equivalent to the topic "fugitive slave ads" and topic "t12" can be considered as "secession". "t29" might be a topic related to ads but could also be about inflation. 

In the following, some exemplatory graphics from the topics are being shown:

![1862medium30](\cleeb94.github.io\img\1862_b16_30.png "top-30 most relevant terms for a medium topic")

The topic 16 has Virginia, a governor and the senate included and seems to be focused on bills passed there. This topic was very popular in the first half of 1862, however, starting with June there is a sharp drop.

![1862t16_30](\cleeb94.github.io\img\1862_g16_30.png "Development over time of the topic 't16'")

The topic 25 seems to be including criminal cases held in court the day before, including arrestments and charges. This topic is relevant throughout the whole year of 1862.

        'yankee'}
```
Here, "t38" clearly focuses on the war and the military just like some of the topics of "mining the dispatch". "t32" seems to be about a criminal charge against a person, a topic that does not seem to be included explicitly in "mining the dispatch".

In the following, some exemplatory graphics from the topics are being shown:

![1862smaller40](\cleeb94.github.io\img\1862_b23_40.png "top-30 most relevant terms for a smaller topic")

Topic 3 is focused on railroads and maybe the transportation of troops which seemed to be an important topic in April 1862. Afterwards, it started slowly declining but had another boost towards the end of the year. 

![1862t16_40](\cleeb94.github.io\img\1862_g3_40.png "Development over time of the topic 't03'")


Topic 35 sounds like the topic can be assigned to poetry as some of the keywords are "young, life, lady, heart, poor". This topic was relevant throughout 1862 with a drop in the month of September.
