This weeks project was to create our own github website using the command line and our private repository. 

After first struggling a little bit with the fact that my website did not want to be published (the name in the _config file was chosen wrongly, as I did not know in the beginning that it had to be our github name), everything worked quite nicely. I was able to change colors, images and the navigation bar and updated the "about me" page with the help of the Markdown tutorial. Furthermore, I created an "additional information" section. 

Finally, I am now writing my first post.

So all in all: a successful set-up of my first github website!
