This weeks project was to create our own github website using the command line and our private repository. 
After first struggeling a little bit with the fact that my website did not want to be published (the name in the _config file was choosen wrongly, as I did not know in the beginning that it had to be our github name), everything worked quite nicely. I was able to change colors and images and upadted the "about me" page and the navigation bar. 
Finally, I am now posting my first post.
So all in all: a successful set-up of my first github website!
