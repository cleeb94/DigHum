Using the data from the dispatch, a social network should be created. For this, the necessary information for the edges (source, target, weight) had to be extracted. In the following code, the places mentioned within one article are being considered. If two cities are mentioned within the same article - an edge is being formed. However, cases, where one city is mentioned more often within one article are being excluded. Then, these edges were collected and counted for each year, meaning that if one connection between two cities (the mentioning of two cities within the same article) occured more often, the weight if that edge was increased.  

```
import re
import os
import itertools

source_location = "./practice3/"   # the folder in which the "dispatch" is
target_location = "./edges/" # the folder in which the new files will be saved
mapData_source = "tgn_coordinates" 

 
lof=os.listdir(source_location) # getting all files from a folder



with open(mapData_source + ".tsv", "r", encoding ="utf8") as f9:
            mapData = f9.read()

def updateDic(dic, key):
    if key in dic:
        dic[key] += 1
    else:
        dic[key]  = 1
        
def edges(edgesList, edgesDic):
    edges = list(itertools.combinations(edgesList, 2))
    for e in edges:
        key = "\t".join(sorted(list(e))) # A > B (sorted alphabetically, to avoid cases of B > A)
        updateDic(edgesDic, key)
            
def collectTaggedToponyms(xmlText, dic,date):
    xmlText = re.sub("\s+", " ", xmlText)
    topList = []
    
    for t in re.findall(r"<placeName[^<]+</placeName>", xmlText):
        t = t.lower()
        if re.search(r'"(tgn,\d+)', t):
            reg = re.search(r'"(tgn,\d+)', t).group(1)
            reg = re.search(r"(\d+)",reg).group(1)
            
            if reg in mapData:
                if reg not in topList:
                    topList.append(reg)

    edges(topList,dic)

def tgn(year):
    weight = []
    source =[]
    target = []
    edgesDic = {}
    
    for f in lof: # looping through all the files            
        with open(source_location + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
            text0 = f1.read() # reads the file in
        
        issue_year=re.search(r"(\d\d\d\d)",text0).group(1)
        
        
        if int(issue_year) == int(year):
            collectTaggedToponyms(text0,edgesDic,year)

    new_file = str(year) + "_edges.tsv"
    header = "source\ttarget\tweight\n"
    for key in edgesDic:
        weight.append(edgesDic[key])
        splitting = key.split("\t")
        source.append(splitting[0])
        target.append(splitting[1])
    

    with open(target_location+new_file, "a") as f3:
        f3.write(header)
        for i in range (0,len(source)):
            f3.write(source[i] + "\t" + target[i] + "\t" + str(weight[i]) + "\n")
        
 
print("1860")
tgn(1860)

print("1861")
tgn(1861)

print("1862")
tgn(1862)
 
print("1863")
tgn(1863)
 
print("1864")
tgn(1864)
 
print("1865")
tgn(1865)
```
Unfortunately, I was unable to manage to include the coordinates of the source and target cities, as my code kept running without terminating or showing any error messages. The code written for this was:

```
import re
import os
import itertools

source_location = "./edges/"   # the folder in which the "dispatch" is
target_location = "./edges/" # the folder in which the new files will be saved 


def tgn(year):
    weight = []
    source =[]
    target = []

    edgesDic = {}

    data_list_lon = ["data"]
    data_list_lat = ["data"]

    data_list_tar_lat = ["data"]
    data_list_tar_lon = ["data"]

    tgn = []
    placeName = []
    lat = []
    lon = []

    
 
    for f in lof: # looping through all the files            
        with open(source_location + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
            text0 = f1.read().split("\n") # reads the file in
            for x in text0:
                x = x.split("\t")
                source.append(x[0])
                target.append(x[1])
                weight.append(x[2])


    new_file = str(1860) + "_edges_probe_merge.tsv"
    header = "source\ttarget\tweight\tlat_source\tlon_source\tlat_target\lon_target\n"
    
    with open ("tgn_coordinates.tsv", "r", encoding = "utf8") as f4:
        text1 = f4.read().split("\n")
        for r in text1:
            r= r.split("\t")  
            tgn.append(r[0])
            placeName.append(r[1])
            lat.append(r[2])
            lon.append(r[3])
    
    with open(target_location+new_file, "a") as f3:
        f3.write(header)
        for i in range (1,len(source)):
            ID=source[i]
            ID_tar = target[i]
            ID_weight= weight[i]
    
            val_lat = lat[tgn.index(ID)]
            data_list_lat.append(val_lat)
            val_lon = lon[tgn.index(ID)]
            data_list_lon.append(val_lon)
    
            val_tar_lat = lat[tgn.index(ID_tar)]
            data_list_tar_lat.append(val_tar_lat)
            val_tar_lon = lon[tgn.index(ID_tar)]
            data_list_tar_lon.append(val_tar_lon)
        
            f3.write(ID + "\t" + ID_tar + "\t" + ID_weight + "\t" + data_list_lat[i] + "\t"+ data_list_lon[i] + "\t" + data_list_tar_lat[i] + "\t" + data_list_tar_lon[i] + "\n")

print("1860")
tgn(1860)

print("1861")
tgn(1861)

print("1862")
tgn(1862)
 
print("1863")
tgn(1863)
 
print("1864")
tgn(1864)
 
print("1865")
tgn(1865)

```
As the process of including the coordinates in the file as well failed, the network could not be created using a geographcal map. However, the size of my edges files was also a problem. Gephi was not able to open the files, always yielding an error that there was not enough memory to open them. This is why, I was unable to provide the networks graphically for each year. 

Instead, I will parts of one of my output files, to show, how they are structured (year 1863):
